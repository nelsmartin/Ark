RNN_training is a recursive nueral network designed to identify typos in text based on this [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html). Encoder_decoder is a sequence to sequence nueral network based on this [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html) that is also designed to identify typos in text. 

Training file format: 
Each line of the training file consists of a correct English sentence on the left, followed by a tab, followed by an incorrect Enlish sentence on the right.
